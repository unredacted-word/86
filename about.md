title: About
---


We wish to provide access to high quality performance parts that abide by three
core principals.

<h2>1. Power is a band-aid</h2>

Power is a band-aid for poor setup and driving. Nobody is impressed if you can
only pass in the straights

<h2>2. Simplify and add lightness</h2>

Weight and simplicity are key. Complexity means more maintenance, more weight,
more cost, more heat, and more futzing at the track that reduces seat time and
fun.

<h2>3. Driving delight</h2>

We believe in a car that reinvigorates the idea of driving delight at an 
affordable price.
