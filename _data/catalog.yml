    Book by Guy Debord, with a new translation by 0xADADA.
    <p>
    This book, and Debordʼs ideas, describe the way we live in the contemporary
    era. The power in his ideas lies in their ability to question, identify, and
    name the common assumptions of our period, and ultimately develops the
    concept of The Spectacle, describing the “gaze” of contemporary culture. It
    continues to influence a variety of philosophical and political movements,
    most notably anti-capitalism, culture jamming, and anarchism.
