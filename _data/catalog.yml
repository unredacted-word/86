    The baroque period of the arts was the first period in which the historical
    time created by the nobility and ruling classes was able to express itself
    as a predominant influence in the discipline of the arts. With the beginning
    of the Enlightenment, the christian world and its explanation of reality was
    challenged by science, rationality, lutheranism, and the protestants. The
    christian world had suddenly lost its unified center, the last remaining
    vestiges of the mythical society which had emerged from the Roman Empire had
    finally lost its singular grasp on society, which it had held during the
    middle ages.
