Rays Wheels uses a 10+ letter SKU that encodes the wheels model in their lineup,
the generation of the forging mold, wheel size & offset, and color. This SKU is
used by retailers to exactly determine the wheels specification. Some authorized
retailers (e.g. Vivid Racing) display the Rays Wheels SKU on their product detail
page while others do not. 

Decoding the Rays Wheels SKU is useful since it allows us to synthetically re-create
SKU numbers that may (or may not) have existed in the past, in lieu of an authoritative
source of historical SKU numbers, so we can search for these numbers on eBay or elsewhere,
where we may find rare wheels that others may not have found.
